Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups.

      "\n",
      "In his farewell speech, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses his gratitude to the people of India and reflects on his five-year tenure as President. He shares 10 key messages that he has gathered from his interactions with people from various walks of life, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development to meet the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Focusing on agricultural growth\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through partnership and courage\n",
      "6. Connecting people for societal transformation\n",
      "7. Defending the nation\n",
      "8. Promoting a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He begins to elaborate on the first message, \"Accelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth\", by sharing a question from a young girl named Anukriti, who asked why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. Kalam appreciates the question and assures her that it is a thoughtful one, setting the stage for his further discussion on this topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciates the question, finds it thoughtful, and assures that the person's dream will be taken to the nation's highest institution and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of India's youth to live in a developed and prosperous country. The speaker reflects on their experiences visiting villages, including a trip to Nagaland, where they saw empowered village councils taking charge of their development. They highlight the need for physical connectivity, such as quality roads, to enable villages to access markets and thrive. The speaker also mentions the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology's initiative, \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA), which aims to provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity to rural areas, leading to economic growth and employment generation. The overall message is the importance of empowering villages and providing them with the necessary resources to drive development and competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment, created entrepreneurs, and developed wasteland into cultivable land. With the help of experts from Japan, the project has developed 55 internationally competitive prototypes for lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative abilities of the villagers. The project serves as a model for sustainable economic development and aims to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a goal of establishing 7000 similar projects across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two experiences. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan and showed interest in various gardens. The speaker emphasizes the need to double agricultural production with limited resources and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \"Seed to Food\". They express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man born without hands and legs, who despite his disabilities, exuded happiness and confidence. The speaker is inspired by Krishna Murthy's positive attitude and his desire to sing, which teaches a lesson about overcoming challenges and succeeding despite adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about two inspiring stories. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first story is about a physically challenged person who, despite his disabilities, has developed a talent for music with the support of his parents, teachers, and others. He even performed at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in 2007, showing that with a positive attitude and perseverance, anyone can achieve their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who showed remarkable resilience and courage in the face of disaster after a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite suffering significant losses, the villagers, with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government, were able to recover and rebuild their lives, demonstrating an indomitable spirit and determination to overcome their challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from a prominent figure, possibly a head of state or government, who is sharing their experiences and observations of people's courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and challenges. The speaker mentions two specific instances:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A visit to a village after an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces, and witnessed the distribution of relief grants to victims.\n",
      "2. A visit to the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they were touched by the courage and community spirit of the tribal islanders, who had taken in affected victims as their own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also shares a poem they composed, called \"Sea Waves\", which reflects the islanders' courage and determination to overcome challenges. The speech also mentions the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament, but the summary is cut off before the details of that event are shared. Overall, the speech highlights the importance of courage, community, and resilience in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network at an African Union meeting, aiming to connect 53 African countries through a satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network at a cost of $100 million. The project includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Connecting 12 universities (7 from India, 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* Connecting 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India, 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* Establishing 53 tele-medicine centers and 53 tele-education centers in Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, with India's Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to Ethiopian students, and specialists from CARE Hospital providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from a Indian leader, possibly a President, who is discussing various topics related to India's progress and development. The key points are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **India-Africa collaboration**: India is providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Africa, and is working with the African continent to bring about societal transformation through technology.\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation**: The leader expresses pride in India's defense forces, highlighting their bravery and commitment to duty, even in adverse circumstances. They also mention interacting with troops, presenting colors to regiments, and meeting family members of defense personnel.\n",
      "3. **Youth movement**: The leader mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes India's progress in technology, defense, and youth development, and highlights the country's collaboration with Africa and its commitment to national security and societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the transformation of Indian youth into enlightened citizens through value-based education and leadership. The speaker mentions the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\" which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, resulting in positive changes such as self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote of a student who was inspired to help her father quit smoking after attending a training camp. The speech concludes by emphasizing the importance of empowering the 540 million youth in India, considering them a powerful resource, and highlights the richness of Indian tradition and the efforts being made to promote unity and cultural diversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and natural resources while pursuing economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, driven by the power of its 540 million youth. They highlight the need for empowerment and equal opportunities for all citizens, and propose a vision for a developed India with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable distribution of energy and water\n",
      "3. Harmonious coexistence of agriculture, industry, and services\n",
      "4. Access to education with a value system for all meritorious candidates\n",
      "5. A hub for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker encourages citizens to work together to achieve this vision, quoting a poem that suggests that with determination and hard work, anything is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a ideal nation with the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Access to quality healthcare for all\n",
      "* Good governance that is transparent and corruption-free\n",
      "* Elimination of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy society with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the vision is for a utopian society where all citizens have access to basic needs and live in a safe and harmonious environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is a conclusion by Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, where he:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Expresses gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the last five years\n",
      "* Shares his mission to unite the hearts and minds of India's multicultural society and instill self-confidence\n",
      "* Commits to working with the citizens to make India a developed nation before 2020\n",
